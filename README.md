Overview:

This project will build a small-scale scenario simulation tool to model airline overbooking situations. Airlines often overbook flights to manage no-shows, but this creates uncertain scenarios when too many passengers arrive. Our simulator will generate synthetic flight scenarios, simulate passenger show-ups, and apply simple bumping rules.

While simple, the project connects to broader research on scenario generators and simulators. The simulator will show how structured, randomized scenarios can be used to test decision rules under resource constraints. This directly complements ongoing research into computable policies and scenario-based analysis, while remaining lightweight enough for a semester project.

The emphasis is on clarity, not complexity: no real airline data, no external APIs, only random synthetic inputs and two bumping strategies. By keeping the scope small, we can focus on:

1. Generating reproducible scenarios.
2.Running simulations to compare outcomes.

3.Producing CSV outputs, plots, and a simple HTML visualization.
